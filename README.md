# Solar System

The coursework assignment involves creating a simple solar system simulation using Three.js, a JavaScript library for 3D graphics rendering. The objective is to render a solar system with one moon orbiting one planet, which in turn orbits one sun. The main goal is to implement basic visual computing techniques, such as rendering 3D objects, handling lighting, and animating movement.

**Learning Outcomes:**
1. **Understanding of Visual Computing**: gain practical experience in visual computing techniques, including rendering, lighting, and animation.
2. **Programming Skills**: develop programming skills in JavaScript, particularly in using Three.js for 3D graphics rendering.
3. **Problem-Solving**: Through implementing the simulation, learn problem-solving skills, especially in handling complex interactions and animations in a 3D environment.
4. **Creativity and Experimentation**: encouraged to experiment with different parameters such as object sizes, colors, and textures, fostering creativity and exploration in visual computing.

**Summary of Coursework Tasks:**
1. **Initialization**: Set up the basic webpage structure with HTML and include JavaScript code using a text editor. Initialize the scene, camera, and renderer in the JavaScript code.
2. **Creating the Scene**: Define global variables for the sun, earth, and moon geometries, materials, and meshes. Create objects for the sun, earth, and moon using Three.js primitives and apply appropriate materials.
3. **Animating the Scene**: Implement animation functions to render the scene and request animation frames. Implement movement for the earth-moon system and sun.
4. **Optional Enhancements**:
   - **Changing Viewpoint**: Add controls to change the observer's viewpoint using OrbitControls.
   - **Texturing**: Apply textures to the sun, earth, and moon using provided image resources.

**Submission**: Submit a short video capturing the working solution along with the HTML file via the designated submission area.
